# Overview

This pipeline is a Nextflow-based workflow designed for the analysis of TB genomic data. It processes raw sequencing data (long-read or short-read) to identify drug resistance mutations based on the World Health Organization (WHO) database, TB lineages, and generates a FHIR-compliant genomics bundle.
